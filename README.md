#Nuxeo FrontEnd

For this front end I used React Coupled with Redux to display and update the Nuxeo
Server that was used for the backend.   

#Set Up

First clone the repository to your local computer. Then in your terminal run:
  npm install -g create-react-app
This command will install the React package that I used. Then once inside the
repository in your terminal run:
  npm install

Finally run:

  npm start

This should open up the front end in your browser.
